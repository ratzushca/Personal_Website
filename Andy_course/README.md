Instructions: The website contains a Home and a Contact page.


Summary

This was my first experience building a website. It took me about 5 hours to fully set it up which I consider a big step forward for myself, usually I spend much more time on things I do for the first time. I learned about CSS and how different styling can be added to a page, as well as how I can create and link pages.
